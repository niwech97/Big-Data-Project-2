# Big-Data-Project-2
Thor, This is our second attempt... We have catalogued our first attempt under attempt 1
We have our main script under the Final R scripts folder 
This main file outlines what it does within the document, but it has four main goals
1) Read in the raw data
2) Clean the raw data
3) Show our loop function
4) Perform our analysis

The thought processes and other work that went into this along with our mistakes are in two main places
The first attempt folder has all of our first attempt work that was 99% of our time and effort
It is in that folder that we initially attempted to perform an impossible analysis with the data we 
had extracted. This is what pushed us to try again with a slightly different dataset
This allowed us to use what we learned from our first attempt to work on a much larger dataset,
and perform the relevant analysis.
