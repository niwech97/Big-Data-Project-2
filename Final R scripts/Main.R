# Main R script


# this script will:
# 1) read in the raw data from csv files
# 2) clean them into new objects
# 3) show our loop function (#out so that you only see it but it does not run
#            because it has already run and the results are in the correct folders)
# 4) perform the relevant analysis on our dataset
